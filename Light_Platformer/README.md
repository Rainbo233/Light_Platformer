Hello! Thank you for downloading our game for the
Backburner Games Game Jam!

This game was made by Spitfire_lll and Rainbo. The goal of this game is to make it to the end of the cave by using your light to find platforms to jump to.
The jumps are very unforgiving, so be prepared to fail!

There will be glowing pickups along the way, enabling you to double jump and dash when collected. There's also a timer above the
player to encourage you to try again and get a better time!

Take your time to plan out an approach, you don't want to make a dumb mistake and start all over, right?

Have fun!

CONTROLS:

A/D to move left and right,
Space to jump,
Left Shift to dash!
